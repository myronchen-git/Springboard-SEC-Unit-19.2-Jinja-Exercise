This is a simple exercise to practice using Flask and Jinja.

(currently 2) to use.  After submitting the story choice, the user is 
directed to a page to enter the words to be used in the story.  After 
submitting the words, the user is presented with the Mad Libs story, 
filled in with the user's words.
